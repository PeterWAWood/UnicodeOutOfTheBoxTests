To run tests...

    $ prove unicode-tests.t

Things to note:

  - "prove" comes with Perl.
  - I've included an extra "fold case" test in with above tests.
  - perl 5.16+ comes with "fc" (fold case)
  - perl 5.12+ required for unicode_strings feature


For tests that pass the two Turkish tests...

    $ prove turkish-pass-tests.t
